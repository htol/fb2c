# MOBI Format Specification

Source: https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/MOBI

## Overview

MOBI is the name given to the format developed for the MobiPocket Reader. It is currently used by Amazon with a slightly different DRM scheme and called AZW. Amazon uses this extension for files created by KindleGen even though they actually have both a MOBI format, sometimes called KF7, and a KF8 format inside the same file.

MOBI format was originally an extension of the PalmDOC format by adding certain HTML like tags to the data. Many MOBI formatted documents still use this form. However there is also a high compression version of this file format that compresses data to a larger degree in a proprietary manner.

## Format

Like PalmDOC, the Mobipocket file format is that of a standard Palm Database Format file. The header of that format includes the name of the database (usually the book title and sometimes a portion of the authors name) which is up to 31 bytes of data. The files are identified as Creator ID of MOBI and a Type of BOOK.

### PalmDOC Header

The first record in the Palm Database Format gives more information about the Mobipocket file. The first 16 bytes are almost identical to the first sixteen bytes of a PalmDOC format file.

| offset | bytes | content | comments |
|--------|-------|---------|----------|
| 0 | 2 | Compression | 1 == no compression, 2 = PalmDOC compression, 17480 = HUFF/CDIC compression |
| 2 | 2 | Unused | Always zero |
| 4 | 4 | text length | Uncompressed length of the entire text of the book |
| 8 | 2 | record count | Number of PDB records used for the text of the book |
| 10 | 2 | record size | Maximum size of each record containing text, always 4096 |
| 12 | 2 | Encryption Type | 0 == no encryption, 1 = Old Mobipocket Encryption, 2 = Mobipocket Encryption |
| 14 | 2 | Unknown | Usually zero |

### MOBI Header

Most Mobipocket file also have a MOBI header in record 0 that follows these 16 bytes, and newer formats also have an EXTH header following the MOBI header, again all in record 0 of the PDB file format.

The MOBI header is of variable length and is not documented. Some fields have been tentatively identified as follows:

**Offsets are from the MOBI marker at offset 0x10 from record start.**

| offset (from record start) | hex  | bytes | content                      | comments                                                                                               |

### EXTH Header

If the MOBI header indicates that there's an EXTH header, it follows immediately after the MOBI header. Since the MOBI header is of variable length, this isn't at any fixed offset in record 0.

| bytes | content | comments |
|-------|---------|----------|
| 4 | identifier | the characters E X T H |
| 4 | header length | the length of the EXTH header, including the previous 4 bytes - but not including the final padding. |
| 4 | record Count | The number of records in the EXTH header. the rest of the EXTH header consists of repeated EXTH records to the end of the EXTH length. |
|  | EXTH record start | Repeat until done. |
| 4 | record type | Exth Record type. Just a number identifying what's stored in the record |
| 4 | record length | length of EXTH record = L , including the 8 bytes in the type and length fields |
| L-8 | record data | Data. |
|  | EXTH record end | Repeat until done. |
| p | padding | Null bytes to pad the EXTH header to a multiple of four bytes (none if the header is already a multiple of four). This padding is not included in the EXTH header length. |

### Variable-width integers

Some parts of the Mobipocket format encode data as variable-width integers. These integers are represented big-endian with 7 bits per byte in bits 1-7. They may be either _forward-encoded_, in which case only the LSB has bit 8 set, or _backward-encoded_, in which case only the MSB has bit 8 set.

### PalmDOC Compression

PalmDOC uses LZ77 compression techniques. DOC files can contain only compressed text. The format does not allow for any text formatting.

PalmDOC data is always divided into 4096 byte blocks (uncompressed size) and the blocks are acted upon independently; no information from previous or later blocks is needed when a block is being compressed or decompressed.

### Image Records

If the file contains images, they follow the text blocks, with each image using a single block. The 4096-byte record size in the PalmDoc header applies only to text records; image records may be larger.

### Magic Records

#### FLIS Record

The FLIS record appears to have a fixed value.

| offset | bytes | content | comments |
|--------|-------|---------|----------|
| 0 | 4 | identifier | the characters F L I S (0x46 0x4c 0x49 0x53) |
| 4 | 4 | ? | fixed value: 8 |
| 8 | 2 | ? | fixed value: 65 |
| 10 | 2 | ? | fixed value: 0 |
| 12 | 4 | ? | fixed value: 0 |
| 16 | 4 | ? | fixed value: -1 (0xFFFFFFFF) |
| 20 | 2 | ? | fixed value: 1 |
| 22 | 2 | ? | fixed value: 3 |
| 24 | 4 | ? | fixed value: 3 |
| 28 | 4 | ? | fixed value: 1 |

#### FCIS Record

The FCIS record appears to have mostly fixed values.

| offset | bytes | content | comments |
|--------|-------|---------|----------|
| 0 | 4 | identifier | the characters F C I S (0x46 0x43 0x49 0x53) |
| 4 | 4 | ? | fixed value: 20 |
| 8 | 4 | ? | fixed value: 16 |
| 12 | 4 | ? | fixed value: 1 |
| 16 | 4 | ? | fixed value: 0 |
| 20 | 4 | ? | text length (the same value as \"text length\" in the PalmDoc header) |
| 24 | 4 | ? | fixed value: 0 |
| 28 | 4 | ? | fixed value: 32 |
| 32 | 4 | ? | fixed value: 8 |
| 36 | 2 | ? | fixed value: 1 |
| 38 | 2 | ? | fixed value: 1 |
| 40 | 4 | ? | fixed value: 0 |

#### End-of-file Record

The end-of-file record is a fixed 4-byte record.

| offset | bytes | content | comments |
|--------|-------|---------|----------|
| 0 | 1 | ? | fixed value: 233 (0xe9) |
| 1 | 1 | ? | fixed value: 142 (0x8e) |
| 2 | 1 | ? | fixed value: 13 (0x0d) |
| 3 | 1 | ? | fixed value: 10 (0x0a) |

### Compilation Records

KindleGen creates records of the compilation source (KindleGen 1.2-2.5) and the compilation source and compiler output (Kindle Gen 2.7-) just before the #End-of-file Record (KindleGen version 1.2-2.2), or just before the BOUNDARY record (KindleGen version 2.3-).

#### SRCS Record

A SRCS record is a record whose content is a zip archive of all source files.

| offset | bytes | content | comments |
|--------|-------|---------|----------|
| 0 | 4 | identifier | \"SRCS\" (0x53 0x52 0x43 0x53) |
| 4 | 4 | ? | fixed value(?): 0x00000010 |
| 8 | 4 | ? | fixed value(?): 0x0000002f |
| 12 | 4 | ? | fixed value(?): 0x00000001 |
| 16 |  | zip | The zip archive continues to the end of this record |

#### CMET Record

A CMET record is a record whose content is the output of the compilation operation.

| offset | bytes | content | comments |
|--------|-------|---------|----------|
| 0 | 4 | identifier | \"CMET\" (0x43 0x4D 0x45 0x54) |
| 4 | 4 | ? | fixed value(?): 0x0000000C |
| 8 | 4 | text length | (big endian) |
| 12 | variable | text | compilation output text, line endings are CRLF |
| variable | variable | ? | unknown data to the end of the record |

### Media Records (AUDI/VIDE)

kindlegen supports embedded audio and video for some Kindle platforms.

| offset | bytes | content | comments |
|--------|-------|---------|----------|
| 0 | 4 | identifier | \"AUDI\" (0x41 0x55 0x44 0x49) or \"VIDE\" (0x56 0x49 0x44 0x45) |
| 4 | 4 | ? | unkown value |
| 8 | 4 | ? | unknown value |
| 12 |  | media | The media data continues to the end of this record |

## Format Limitations

There are many limitations in the MOBI format:
- Blocks of text can never have a greater than normal margin on their right side.
- Left margins can only be specified in 1em increments.
- Text cannot flow around images taller than one line of text.
- Image sizes cannot be scaled with font size.
- Nested tables are not supported at all.
- Tables display wildly differently on different Mobipocket renderers.
